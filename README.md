## Project Description

My project is an bachelor/bachelorette application for Marvel heroes and vilians. When users first enter the application they will be welcomed and prompted to choose whether they're looking for a male, female or other. Then a list will generate of all the heros and villians who are under that category. At the top of the screen there will be a filter that further targets the kind of person the user is looking for: race (human/other), alignment, intellegence and power.
